# Dye Gap Adjustment Tool
This is a small program I wrote for Printware, LLC. The standard printing software that came with their printers adjust all dye gaps in unison. This program allows for granular calibration of each dye gap independently. The dyes gap values range from -200 to 200 and are rounded to multiples of 8.

### File Versions
- dgat.py - is the main program
- dgat2.py - was an attempt at using the printer's undocumented XML REST API
